            <h2>Hello</h2>
            <p>I am a beginner in Web development and Programming in general. I have experience in Python, a bit of C and SQL, HTML and CSS. I am an inquisitive person and a fast learner and a good problem solver. My curiosity in the field of computer science drives me and gives me motivation to keep learning and improve myself technically and as a person.</p>

                <h3>Techical Skills</h3>
                <p class = "sk">I am a good problem solver and I pride myself for not giving up until I solve or finish something. I have a keen eye for troubleshooting and correcting errors in programmes, and have a good understanding of programming languages that I have mentioned above such as Python, HTML, CSS, C and SQL. I have recently started Web Development  and this site is an mile stone for me as I have incorporated my knowledge in HTML and CSS to create it. I also have basic knowledge in Machine Learning and how to use GitHub and I was also a part of the robotics club in my school.</p>

                <h3>Soft Skills</h3>
                <p class = "sk">I am your friendly neighborhood fresher🕸️. I am a calm, composed person and have god communication and decision making skills, these traits allow me to connect with my peers and these are the traits that I believe makes me a Leader. I am good at quizzing and I had represented my school in many inter school competition in and out of my state and had reached state level in a nation wide heritage quiz. I have some experience in public speaking too as I have attended few inter and intra school MUNs and this helped me improve my social skills. I can also solve a 3 x 3 Rubik's Cube, so I have my way around algorithms too 😉👍.</p>
